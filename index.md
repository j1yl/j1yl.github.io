### CPSC 120

- Lab 11: In this lab, I learned about classes and how to use them. It was very fun working with data in a csv format and utilizing 2d vectors to access specific indices. I learned that a small mistake when working when 2d vectors can cost a lot of time to debug. [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-11-joe-shyan-diego)
- Lab 8: In this lab, I learned about using the file stream and working with inputs and outputs. It was a great experience learning about writing to a file in part 2 of the lab. My favorite part of the lab is part 3 when we worked with animations by using loops. [Lab 8](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-08-joe-caleb)
- Lab 9: In this lab, I was introduced to algorithms in C++. It was very fun figuring out the intricate portions of the algorithm and implementing it to become a spell checker. [Lab 9](https://github.com/cpsc-pilot-fall-2022/cpsc-120-lab-09-joe-caleb-1)
